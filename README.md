# Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Lucas Moura de Oliveira ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about **Data Science and Machine Learning**. My journey started when I built my first machine learning project using **Python** and **AutoGluon**, and since then, my enthusiasm has only grown.

Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge and practical experience in data science and machine learning, while strengthening my skills in **Python**, **SQL**, and **Go**. I enjoy working with these tools and exploring how they can solve meaningful problems.

My goal is to steadily grow into a role as a **Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer**. I am eager to apply my passion and technical foundation in real-world projects and collaborate with teams that value learning, innovation, and impact.

If youâ€™re looking for someone motivated, collaborative, and dedicated to continuous growth, letâ€™s connect!
